# React Admin Dashboard Project

## Introduction

Welcome to my React Admin Dashboard project! This is where I've been practicing my React and TypeScript skills. I've built an admin dashboard that provides insights into sales and user data, giving me a hands-on playground to explore and improve my frontend development abilities.

## Preview

I've included some preview images below so you can get an idea of how the project looks and feels.
